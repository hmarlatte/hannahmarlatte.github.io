This course explores theoretical accounts of psychiatric and neurological disorders through the lens of cognitive experimental psychology, including how both traditional and contemporay approaches inform therapeutic interventions. I independently designed and developed this course as a special offering within the department, addressing a gap in their clinical course list that had not be offered in 10 years.
