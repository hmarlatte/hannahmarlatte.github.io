PSY493: Cognitive Neuroscience\
 *Winter 2025, Fall 2024, Fall 2024*\
This capstone survey course explores research on how the mind arises from the brain, covering how varying levels of neural activity — from cellular mechanisms to functional networks — support cognitive processes. This ranges from early perception and attention to memory and higher cognitive control, as well as applications such as psychopathology and consciousness. Secondary objectives included understanding current cognitive neuroscience methods and engaging critically with primary research in the field. 


PSY342: Cogniton and Psychopathology\
 *Summer 2024*\
This course explores theoretical accounts of psychiatric and neurological disorders through the lens of cognitive experimental psychology, including how both traditional and contemporay approaches inform current therapies. I independently designed and developed this course as a special offering within the department, addressing a gap in their clinical course list that had not be offered in 10 years.
