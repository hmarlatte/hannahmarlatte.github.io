I am broadly interested in studying the individual differences that lead to mental simulation deficits in post-traumatic stress disorder. To do so, I utilize eye tracking and neuroimaging to understand the gaze and neural correlates of different aspects of these deficits in adults, along with mixed method approaches to analyse pariticpants' narrative. I am also interested in extending this work into adolescence, a life period where experiencing trauma is greater, to better understand the predisposing factors for disorder development and maintenance into adulthood.

**Visual exploration during mental simulation through eye movements**
-despite the bidirectional impact eye movements and memory processing have on each other, little work has measured gaze behaviour during mental simulation tasks with individuals with PTSD. This can inform our understanding of changes in hippocampal-related visual exploration, supplementing our understanding of memory and spatial processing deficits commonly seen in this population.
-a major treatment for PTSD critically involves altering gaze behaviour (i.e. Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy), however its mechanism is currently unknown. Understanding differences in baseline gaze behaviour and the potentially differential impact gaze manipulations can have on mental simulation in those with PTSD will further our understanding of the mechanism of this treatmeant, leading to its more effective implementation.

**Past and future thinking in adolescence**
-little work has examined mental simulation in adolescence, and what has been done has focused on autobiographical memory to valenced cues.
-whether and how mental simulation deficits as more broadly seen in adults are present is an open question, as well as if they are associated with hippocampal and prefrontal disturbances. Critically, this can inform the development of age-appropriate interventions to mitigate the long-term effects of traumatic stress, especially when personal autobiographical recall or future thinking may be challenging. 
-whether neurocognitive changes after experiencing developmental trauma lead to commonly reported deficits in adulthood is currently unknown.  Longitudinal examinations of the trajectory of neurocognitive changes into adulthood are needed to better understand predisposing factors for disorder development and maintenance across this critical period.

**Neural dynamics during mental simulation**
-a hallmark symptom of PTSD is experiencing highly sensory in-the-moment intrusive recollections that are fragmented (i.e. flashback memories) and this fragmented nature has been noted to extend to the mental simulation of everyday events. However, if and how interactions between hippocampal, prefrontal and sensory cortices are disturbed to support this phenomenon is unknown.
-disturbances in detail generation of mental simulations (i.e. the number of details) and their spatial coherence (i.e. how fragmented it is) may be separable, albeit interdependent, aspects of mental simulation. Expounding the functional neural correlates of these two subprocesses can inform theories of hippocampal function and neurocognitive models of PTSD.
