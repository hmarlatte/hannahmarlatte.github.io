I am completing my doctoral research in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto, working at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest with [Dr. Asaf Gilboa](https://www.gilboalab.ca) and [Dr. Jennifer Ryan](https://drjenryan.com). My research program focuses on how trauma and stress influence our ability to imagine, navigate, and explore new environments in both adolescence and adulthood. I employ a variety of methods, including neuroimaging, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring, behavioral coding, and computational and qualitative narrative analysis to explore these effects in applied (e.g., occupational stress in police officers with [Dr. Judith Andersen](https://www.hartlab.net) and clinical settings (e.g., individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder). Ultimately, my work aims to inform the development of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term impact of traumatic stress and improve cognitive function across the lifespan. 

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to teaching, particularly in statistical methods and at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health. For instance, I have independently designed and developed an undergraduate course on the topic (PSY 342: Cognition and Psychopathology), taught a fourth-year survey course on cognitive neuroscience and related methodology several times (PSY493: Cognitive Neuroscience), and frequently assisted in teaching both undergraduate and graduate level statistics. 

In my free time, you can find me baking something without a recipe, drying flowers to later arrange, or befriending a tree in the ravines.
