As a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto, my research prorgam focuses on how trauma and stress influence our ability to imagine, navigate, and explore new environments in both adolescence and adulthood. I employ a variety of methods, including neuroimaging, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring, behavioral coding, and computational and qualitative narrative analysis to explore these effects in applied (e.g., occupational stress in police) and clinical settings (e.g., individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder). Ultimately, my work aims to inform the development of therapeutic interventions to reduce the long-term impact of trauma and improve cognitive function. In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to teaching and course development, particularly at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health.
